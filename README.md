Welcome to RethInkscape
=========================

We are a group of UX, designers, and front-end developers. We use inkscape on our daily basis and we love it.

Inkscape it’s open source, free, powerful and standard compliant. It makes web development and vectorial design easy and it’s widely supported by the community.

After some years using it as our main design software we decided we should contribute to the community with what we know how to do better: our passion for design and usability.
