   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

=======================================
Welcome to RethInkscape docs!
=======================================

We are a group of UX, designers, and front-end developers. We use `inkscape <https://www.inkscape.org>`_ on our daily basis and we love it.

Inkscape it's open source, free, powerful and standard compliant. It makes web development and vectorial design easy and it's widely supported by the community.

After some years using it as our main design software we decided we should contribute to the community with what we know how to do better: our passion for design and usability. As a kind Inkscape developer told us *"You'll be most passionate and effective with either what you know best, or what you desire the most."*
