Project Goals
=================================

We’ve made several working sessions to clarify the main inkscape problems in terms of user experience. We got to a list of good and bad things that lead us to what we find are the major issues that we will approach:
- There are a lot of non key features at plain sight and at the same level of the basic ones.
- There is no consistency in the user flow
- There is room for improvements on visual design.

With this in mind we decided to focus our inkscape redesign proposal on three basic concepts:

Structure
------------------------
We find the current layout structure a bit chaotic. Grouping the type of content and functionalities provided to the user will greatly facilitate his tasks. Defining areas can facilitate the user recognizing what he need without using his memory. We’ll discriminate between tools, subtools, panels and info. You can read more about *recognition rather than recall:* http://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/ .

Tools organization and hierarchy
------------------------------------------
We find several usability issues on current tools placements and organization. There are too many options at plain sight, with a questionable or difficult to understand organization and with no apparent hierarchy. We’ll make a proposal that involves grouping similar tools, organizing them with some kind of hierarchy and displaying options and parameters consistently.

Visual Simplicity
-------------------------------
Visual design can make the difference if we want inkscape to be used by all kind of designers (Visual, UX, Graphic, Interaction...) and non professional users. A modern, simple and visually beautiful interface will improve user experience and minimize the difference against (proprietary) competitors.
