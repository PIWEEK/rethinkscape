Barriers, Facilitators & Insights
=================================

*Barriers :(*

- There're a lot of unused features at plain sight
- It's hard to find specific functionalities
- It's hard to understand the tools
- There's no consistency on user's workflow
- There's no order on tools placements
- Poor system status visibility (ie: being inside groups or sublayers)
- It does not follow UI standards
- Visual design is not minimalistic
- Custom color palette?
- Room for improvements on filters
- Room for improvements on groups & layers management
- Room for improvements on gradients

*Facilitators :)*

- Complies with image standards
- Powerful shortcuts system
- Cool color palette management through bottom bar
- Great text management
- Great align and arrange management
- Awesome SVG management, including code editing
- It's OPEN SOURCE and all that this means

*A big insight*

- Open Source tools diminish value for a lack of design
