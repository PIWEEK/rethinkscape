Why Inkscape?
=================================
Inkscape is a free and open source software vector graphics editor. Its goal is to implement full support for the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1 standard. Inkscape is cross-platform[7] and runs on OS X, Unix-like operating systems, and Microsoft Windows.

Inkscape began in 2003 as a code fork of the Sodipodi project. Since then, Inkscape grew to become the reference in the open source community regarding vectorial design.

Contribute to such a big and important project is not easy but we love challenges. So, Why Inkscape?

We love Inkscape
----------------
We are a group of UX, designers and front-end developers. We use inkscape on our daily basis and we love it.

Inkscape it's open source, free, powerful and standard compliant. It makes web development and vectorial design easy and it's widely supported by the community.

After some years using it as our main design software we decided we should contribute to the community with what we know how to do better: our passion for design. As Josh Andler, Inkscape developer told us *"You'll be most passionate and effective with either what you know best, or what you desire the most."*

Adobe Monopoly and Sketch opposition
-------------------------------------
If you are already a user of Inkscape, you probably know why we should use open source software. But, if not, you probably experienced some of the lately changes happened in Adobe.

- Adobe has raised prices (it was very expensive, now it's monthly paid).
- The company thinks in their own interest before their users opinion.
- A lot of people is using keygens to avoid paying its price which means free way virus and trojans.
- Users cannot choose their operating system (again, a non open source system)

In the last years lot of users changed to *Sketch*, a fresh new alternative for *Adobe Illustrator*. Users are paying a medium price (around 80â‚¬) for a far lower featured application. Still, this is a closed source software only available for OSX users.

Usability and design problems
-----------------------------
We agree that Inkscape is a powerful tool. Born in 2003 and developed actively since then, it probably never had an actual UX and design work behind and lots of features have been added in every version of the software.

Most current Inkscape developers recognize that Inkscape UI could use some serious work. Most of its features have been added piece-meal over the years with out much thought about consistency.

Designers and industry lack of interest
----------------------------------------
Doing some research in the last months while this project was around our heads, we talked to many designers and developers both in the open source industry or not and most of them agreed on the same: Inkscape seems to be an unstable, not proffesional, inmature and with a lack of features. The reason: its usability and design.

Surprisingly, when we analyzed the features that our designers use in their everyday work, they found out that these features where largely covered by inkscape, and in some cases, this features were richer than its closed counterpart.
