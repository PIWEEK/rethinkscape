            <p>Inkscape it’s open source, free, powerful and standard compliant. It makes web development and vectorial design easy and it’s widely supported by the community.</p>
            <p>Born in 2003 and developed actively since then, it probably never had an actual UX and design work behind. By fixing this, we want to help Inkscape to be<strong> the best tool for every kind of designer.</strong></p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>We believe that grouping the type of content and functionalities provided to the user will greatly facilitate his tasks. Defining areas will help the user recognizing what he need without using his memory. We’ll discriminate between tools, subtools, panels and info.</p>

            <li class="tools-settings"><strong>Tool settings</strong>: Here the user will always find settings and paramaters of the tools.</li>
            <li class="colors"><strong>Colors Palette</strong>: We love the current color palette, is useful and cool at the same time. We just want to leave it like it is.</li>
            <li class="info"><strong>Info bar</strong>: User will always find info in this area. Just to know about his current status, never to modify things.</li>

            <p>We find several usability issues on current tools placements and organization. There are too many options at plain sight, with a questionable or difficult to understand organization and with no apparent hierarchy.</p>
            <p>Our proposal implies grouping similar tools, organizing them with some kind of hierarchy and displaying options and parameters consistently.</p>

            <li class="panels"><strong>Panels</strong>: This group is for windows with configurable settings, what we indetified as the second level on the user's needs.</li>
            <li class="document"><strong>Document settings</strong>: The special one. Important but with low frequency of use, thats why it's separated from the rest.</li>
