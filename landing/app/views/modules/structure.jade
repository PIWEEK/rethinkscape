            li <strong>Toolbar</strong>: Here the user will find every tool that he needs to perform his tasks.
            li <strong>Sub-tools</strong>: Here the user will always find settings and paramaters of the tools.
            li <strong>Panels</strong>: Complex modifiers and parameter panels.
            li <strong>Colors Palette</strong>: We love the current color palette, is useful and cool at the same time. We just want to leave it like it is.
            li <strong>Info bar</strong>: User will always find info in this area. Just to know about his current status, never to modify things.
