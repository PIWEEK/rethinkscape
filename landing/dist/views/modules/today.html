        <p>Inkscape it’s open source, free, powerful and standard compliant. It makes web development and vectorial design easy and it’s widely supported by the community.</p>
        <p>Born in 2003 and developed actively since then, it probably never had an actual UX and design work behind. By fixing this, we want to help Inkscape to be<strong> the best tool for every kind of designer.</strong></p>
